template.name: "Develop a Knative Service app~otc-ui1231"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, and deploy a Knative service application securely into a Kubernetes cluster that is managed by the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters in the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain).~otc-ui1232"
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which is scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain?task=2) for this toolchain.~otc-ui1233"
